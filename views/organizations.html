	    							The Street Team is a fully incorporated program of the Harvard Square Homeless Shelter, consisting of 21 trained volunteers, that runs from November 1st to April 15th.

									Each night, a group of 3 volunteers arrives at the Shelter around 7:45 to prepare sandwiches and pack up other food before going out into Harvard Square to provide individuals with basic amenities such as food, blankets, and socks; distribute information about available resources (i.e. healthcare, job searches, food during the day, etc.); refer individuals to local shelters; and build relationships with people sleeping outside.

									The commitment for Street Team consists of initial training, participating in one weekly night shift from 7:45 PM to 10:00 PM, and coming to an hour-long meeting twice a month. Street Team shifts are a low time commitment, but they have high rewards â€” shifts can be incredible and sometimes draining despite their shortness.

									Generally drawing on student volunteers with no prior experience with the homeless, Street Team looks only for enthusiasm, compassion, and a willingness to brave the cold.

Over 50 student teams have been designing and building model solar-powered cars this spring, led by STEM professionals who volunteer their time as teachers. Students will compete to find the best-designed and fastest car. WE NEED YOU to help students see the value and potential of their efforts by volunteering at the Junior Solar Sprint. This is a great opportunity to help young people connect their effort and creativity with a sense of opportunity in the future!
